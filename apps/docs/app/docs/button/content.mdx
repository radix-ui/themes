# Button

Use buttons to trigger actions throughout your interface. Buttons are promises of what happens next. Design them to build user confidence and guide decision-making naturally.

This is an enhanced version of the Button component from [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes). For the original API reference, see the [Radix Themes Button documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/components/button).

## Variants

Use the `variant` prop to set button style.

### Classic

Elevated style with subtle shadow for maximum visual impact and primary actions.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="classic">
  Button
</Button>
```

### Solid

Filled background for primary actions and important CTAs.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="solid">
  Button
</Button>
```

### Soft

Subtle background for secondary actions and content-heavy interfaces.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="soft">
  Button
</Button>
```

### Outline

Bordered style for secondary actions and form controls.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="outline">
  Button
</Button>
```

### Surface

Elevated surface for content-heavy UIs and card-based layouts.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="surface">
  Button
</Button>
```

### Ghost

Minimal style for utility actions and inline text integration.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="ghost">
  Button
</Button>
```

## Sizes

Set `size` for button density: `1` (24px), `2` (32px), `3` (40px), `4` (48px). Use `3` or `4` for mobile touch targets. Supports responsive objects like `{ initial: '1', sm: '2', md: '3', lg: '4' }`.

### Size 1

For toolbars and dense interfaces.

```tsx
<Button size="1">Button</Button>
```

### Size 2

For standard interface contexts.

```tsx
<Button size="2">Button</Button>
```

### Size 3

For important actions and mobile touch targets.

```tsx
<Button size="3">Button</Button>
```

### Size 4

For hero sections and maximum impact.

```tsx
<Button size="4">Button</Button>
```

## Colors

Use the `color` prop with semantic colors to communicate the action's intent to users. Use `highContrast` for maximum visibility, especially on complex or translucent backgrounds.

```tsx
<Button size="3" color="crimson" variant="solid">
  Button
</Button>
<Button size="3" color="crimson" variant="solid" highContrast>
  Button
</Button>
```

## Material

Use the `material` prop to set button appearance. Choose `solid` for opaque backgrounds, or `translucent` for depth and separation over images or dynamic backgrounds. Avoid `outline` and `ghost` variants with translucent material, as they may lack contrast.

### Theme

Buttons automatically inherit the theme's material setting. Wrap your interface in a `Theme` component to control material globally:

```tsx
<Theme material="translucent">
  <Button size="3" color="gray" highContrast variant="soft">
    Button
  </Button>
</Theme>
```

### Custom

Override the theme's material for a button when you need a specific effect. Translucent effects only show over backgrounds—use `highContrast` for readability.

```tsx
<Theme material="solid">
  <Button material="translucent" size="3" color="gray" highContrast variant="soft">
    Button
  </Button>
</Theme>
```

## States

### Loading

Set `loading` to `true` to show a spinner and disable the button. No need to set `disabled` manually.

```tsx
<Button size="3" color="gray" highContrast loading>
  Submitting...
</Button>
```

### Disabled

Set the `disabled` prop to `true` to prevent interaction when an action is unavailable, such as during form validation or when authentication is required.

```tsx
<Button size="3" disabled tooltip="Please fill all required fields">
  Save
</Button>
```

### Interactive

Buttons handle focus for keyboard navigation. For complex patterns, use `data-state` for custom visuals.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="classic" data-state="open">
  Open
</Button>
<Button size="3" variant="classic" data-state="on">
  On
</Button>
```

## Layout

### Full Width

Set the `fullWidth` prop to `true` to make the button fill its container. This is useful for mobile layouts and form submissions.

```tsx
<Flex direction="column" gap="2" width="300px">
  <Button size="3" variant="soft" color="gray" highContrast fullWidth>
    Complete
  </Button>
</Flex>
```

### Flush

Use the `flush` prop with the `ghost` variant to remove padding, making the button blend with text while staying interactive.

```tsx
<Flex gap="2" align="center">
  <Button size="3" variant="ghost" flush>
    Learn
  </Button>{' '}
  about us.
</Flex>
```

## Margin

Use margin props for spacing around buttons. All margin props are responsive and accept design tokens or CSS values.

```tsx
<Button size="3" variant="soft" mx="2">
  Button
</Button>
<Button size="3" variant="soft" mx="2">
  Button
</Button>
```

## Tooltips

Use the `tooltip` prop to add context to button actions, especially for icon buttons or unclear actions. Tooltips appear on hover and focus for accessibility. Always provide a tooltip for icon-only buttons.

```tsx
<Button variant="soft" size="3" tooltip="Save your current progress">
  Button
</Button>
```

## Icons

Place icons directly inside buttons; they'll be sized automatically based on the button's size.

```tsx
import { Check } from 'lucide-react';

<Button size="3">
  <Check />
  Save
</Button>
```

For icon-only buttons, use the `IconButton` component for proper accessibility and touch targets.

```tsx
import { ChevronDown } from 'lucide-react';

<IconButton size="3" variant="soft" aria-label="More options">
  <ChevronDown />
</IconButton>
```

## Polymorphism

### As

Use the `as` prop to render buttons as different HTML elements while maintaining button styling. This is useful for navigation links, routing integration, or custom interactive elements that need button appearance.

```tsx
<Button size="3" as="a" href="/home">
  Go Home
</Button>
```

### AsChild

Use the `asChild` prop to merge button props with a child element using the Radix Slot pattern. This is ideal for composition with routing libraries like Next.js Link or React Router, as it applies button styling without creating an additional wrapper element.

```tsx
<Button size="3" asChild>
  <a href="/dashboard">Go to Dashboard</a>
</Button>
```

## Responsive

Use responsive objects with the `size` prop to adapt button sizing across different breakpoints. The component uses a mobile-first approach where each breakpoint applies styles at its minimum width and above.

```tsx
<Button size={{ initial: '1', sm: '2', md: '3' }}>Button</Button>
```

## Form

Use standard HTML form attributes to integrate buttons with forms. The component supports all form attributes for comprehensive form integration, including loading states for async operations and validation-based disabled states.

```tsx
<Button type="submit" size="3">
  Submit
</Button>
```

Button also supports customizable tooltip props for content, position, timing, and behavior. Additionally, all margin props (`m`, `mx`, `my`, `mt`, `mr`, `mb`, `ml`) are supported with responsive values.

## Accessibility

Kookie UI's Button extends Radix's accessibility foundation with enhanced loading states and built-in tooltip support.

### Enhanced Loading States

Loading states automatically apply comprehensive ARIA attributes:

- `aria-busy="true"` - announces processing state
- `aria-disabled="true"` - prevents interaction
- `aria-describedby` - links to loading announcement
- `aria-label` - dynamically includes "(loading)" status

Loading announcements include: "[Button text] is loading, please wait..."

### Keyboard Navigation

- Full keyboard support with Enter and Space keys
- Visible focus indicators for all variants
- Enhanced focus management for Windows High Contrast mode

### Screen Readers

- Semantic button elements with proper roles
- Loading state announcements
- Tooltip associations via `aria-describedby`
- Disabled state announcements

## Enhancements

Kookie UI extends Radix Themes Button with practical improvements:

### Built-in Tooltip Support

Native `tooltip` prop eliminates need for wrapper components. Tooltips automatically provide accessibility through `aria-describedby` associations and support positioning via `tooltipSide` and `tooltipAlign` props.

### Override Styles

Advanced `overrideStyles` prop enables per-state style customization using design tokens. Define styles for normal, hover, active, pressed, open, disabled, and focus states without writing CSS.

### Enhanced Loading State

Loading state automatically disables interaction and displays spinner. Screen readers announce loading context with proper `aria-busy` and `aria-disabled` attributes.

### Flush Mode

`flush` prop removes padding for seamless text integration, especially with ghost variant. Creates inline button behavior while maintaining interactive touch targets.
