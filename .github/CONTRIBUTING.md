## Preparing a Pull Request

[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers.

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/themes.git
cd themes
git remote add upstream https://github.com/radix-ui/themes.git
```

1. Synchronize your local `main` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

1. Make sure your Node version matches the [.nvmrc](../.nvmrc).

```
node -v
```

1. Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```sh
pnpm install
```

1. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b my-bug-fix
```

6. Make changes, then commit and push to your forked repository:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

7. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/pulls) and [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

8. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

## Working locally

The repo is managed with [pnpm Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo).

### Development

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# start Storybook and see examples in the browser
pnpm dev
```

After staring the development server, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/sink` to view the playground. Visit other demos by navigating to pages in the app directory (./app/\*), such as `/demo`, `/explore-components`, `/home-os`.

Make your changes and check that they resolve the problem with an example in `/sink` or another demo page. If there are no examples in the playground to support your change, we suggest adding one and then running local development to make sure nothing is broken.

Lastly, run `pnpm build` to ensure that the build runs successfully before submitting the pull request.
